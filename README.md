A small console game written in Nim.

### Compile
```
nim default asteroids.nim
```

### Run
```
./asteroids
```
It requires a Unicode compatible console to work best. Unfortunately it doesn't really work well on Windows.

### Controls
- Movement:  
`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`
- Fire:  
`space`
- Quit:  
`q`

### Highscore
My personal highscore is **188**.
